# Patches for Evolution X
These patches are used to improve the experience of Evolution X on tablets.

## Changes
* Added a lid behavior switch in Evolver for users who wake the device with a magnetic cover.
* Added a DT2W switch in Evolver for those who may need to use this feature (DT2W on the J607F consumes a lot of extra power, but at the same time its power button is easily damaged, so add this switch for those who need longer battery life)
